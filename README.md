Column Creation (10 points)
On the same worksheet as the raw data, or on a new worksheet all columns were correctly created for:

ticker symbol (2.5 points)
total stock volume (2.5 points)
yearly change ($) (2.5 points)
percent change (2.5 points)

The grading requirment above for the 3rd option (yearly change) it has a $ sign I wasn't sure if it was asking us to format the cell into currecny I did it anyways. But I commented it out not sure if you guys will run that.
